## ✨ About Dhruva  
Campus offices are overloaded with repetitive queries — fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetables — and students often prefer asking in regional languages, while official information is locked inside PDFs in English.  
**Dhruva** bridges this gap by providing:  
- Multilingual support (English, Hindi, Tamil, more coming soon)  
- Instant answers from official documents (circulars, FAQs, policies)  
- 24/7 availability on **Website, Telegram, and WhatsApp**  
- A fallback to staff contact when Dhruva is unsure  
- Community-driven improvement via **“Help Us Improve Dhruva”** feature
