## About Dhruva
Campus offices are overloaded with repetitive queries — fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetables — and students often prefer asking in regional languages, while official information is locked inside PDFs in English.  

**Dhruva** bridges this gap by providing:

- **Multilingual support** (English, Hindi, Tamil, more coming soon)  
- **Instant answers** from official documents (circulars, FAQs, policies)  
- **24/7 availability** on Website, Telegram, and WhatsApp  
- **Fallback** to staff contact when Dhruva is unsure  
- **Community-driven improvement** via “Help Us Improve Dhruva” feature

## Features

- **Multilingual Q&A** → GPT-powered, answers in student’s preferred language  
- **Document Grounding** → Uses embeddings + cosine similarity to fetch answers from PDFs  
- **Cross-Platform** → Integrated with Website, Telegram, and preview WhatsApp bot  
- **Fallback Mode** → Shares staff contact info if answer is missing/uncertain  
- **Community Contribution** → Users can help improve Dhruva by submitting answers Dhruva missed  
- **Future Scope**:  
  - Multi-turn conversational context  
  - Speech-to-Text (STT) & Text-to-Speech (TTS)  
  - Auto-generation of student letters (e.g., Bonafide certificates)
